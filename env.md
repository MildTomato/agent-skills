Overview

Environments provide a way to manage sets of environment variables and secrets for different stages of a project's lifecycle. They are the mechanism through which configuration values in config.json are resolved at runtime, both locally and on the platform.

This document covers the data model, CLI commands, resolution logic, and the workflows for both remote-first and local-first development modes.

Core Concepts

What Is an Environment?

An environment is a named collection of key-value pairs (environment variables) stored on the platform. Each variable belongs to exactly one environment. There is no inheritance between environments — each is an independent, flat set of variables.

Default Environments

Every project is created with two branches (main and dev) and three environments:

Environment

Purpose

Mapped to

development

Local development via cli dev. Contains values that work on a developer's machine (localhost URLs, local database, debug settings).

Not mapped to a branch — mapped to local execution.

preview

Deployed preview environments. Contains values for hosted preview infrastructure.

dev branch and all other non-production branches (via wildcard).

production

Live, user-facing deployment. Starts empty and is populated when the project is ready to go live.

main branch.

All three default environments cannot be deleted or renamed.

The key distinction: development is for running locally, preview is for deploying remotely. A developer on the dev branch uses development variables when running cli dev on their machine, and preview variables when their code is deployed as a preview on the platform.

What Is a Project Branch?

A project branch is a forked copy of the project's infrastructure running independently on its own URL. It is a first-class platform concept — not a Git concept. There are three ways a project branch gets created:

From the dashboard — the user creates a branch directly in the platform UI. No Git involvement.

Via GitHub integration — a Git branch push triggers the creation of a corresponding project branch (named the same by default) through GitHub webhooks.

From the CLI — the user creates a project branch directly via CLI commands.

We intend to have the cli dev command sync project branch creation and environment switching to the local Git workflow in remote-first dev mode, so that switching Git branches locally would automatically activate the corresponding project branch and reload the environment. The details of this behavior are still being finalized.

Every project starts with two project branches: main and dev.

Custom Environments

Users can create additional environments (e.g., staging, qa, testing) for specialized workflows. Custom environments behave identically to the defaults — they are independent sets of variables with no special relationship to other environments.

Branch-to-Environment Mapping

Each project branch resolves to a single deployed environment. The mapping is configured in config.json:

{
"environments": {
"production": "main",
"preview": "\*"
}
}

This is the default configuration for new projects. The dev project branch (and any other non-production branch) maps to preview via the wildcard. Users can add custom mappings as the project grows:

{
"environments": {
"production": "main",
"staging": "staging",
"preview": "\*"
}
}

The key is the environment name, the value is the project branch name or "\*" for the wildcard (catch-all). The wildcard entry defines the default environment for any project branch not explicitly listed. If no wildcard is defined, unmapped branches fall back to preview.

The mapping is evaluated top-to-bottom; first explicit match wins, wildcard is always last. A project branch can only map to one environment.

Note: development does not appear in the branch mapping. It is not a deployment target — it is exclusively for local execution via cli dev.

Platform Variables vs User Variables

Environment variables fall into two categories. Both live in the same environment, use the same CLI commands, and appear in the same dashboard — the difference is in how they are created and referenced in config.

Platform Variables (implicit binding)

The platform knows its own config schema. Every config key that requires a secret or environment-specific value has a canonical environment variable name derived from the config path. For example:

Config path

Canonical variable

auth.external.google.client_id

SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID

auth.external.google.secret

SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_SECRET

db.pooler.default_pool_size

SUPABASE_DB_POOLER_DEFAULT_POOL_SIZE

The user does not need to write env() for these. The config block simply declares the feature:

{
"auth": {
"external": {
"google": {
"enabled": true
}
}
}
}

The platform knows that enabling Google auth requires SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_SECRET, and resolves them from the environment automatically.

Scaffolding on feature activation

When a feature is enabled (via the dashboard or the CLI), the platform automatically creates the required variables as empty entries in the current environment, with the appropriate type (standard or secret). The CLI prompts the user to fill them in:

Google OAuth requires 2 variables:

SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
Value: 1234567890.apps.googleusercontent.com ✓

SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_SECRET
Value (hidden): ••••••••••••• ✓
Stored as secret.

✓ Added to "development" environment.

Missing variable warnings

When the CLI encounters an enabled feature with missing variables (e.g., during cli dev), it warns with actionable guidance:

Warning: auth.external.google is enabled but missing required variables:
SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_SECRET

Set them with:
cli env set SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID "your-value" --env development
cli env set SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_SECRET "your-value" --env development --secret

Or add them to supabase/.env.local for local development.

Sensitive fields cannot be hardcoded

The platform schema marks certain config fields as sensitive (e.g., auth.external.google.secret, any field containing keys, tokens, or passwords). These fields must come from an environment variable — either via implicit binding or explicit env() reference. If the CLI detects a raw value in a sensitive field, it fails with a clear error:

Error: auth.external.google.secret is a sensitive field and cannot be hardcoded in config.json.

Set it with:
cli env set SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_SECRET "your-value" --env development --secret

Or add it to supabase/.env for local development:
SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_SECRET=your-value

This prevents accidental secret leaks through config.json, which is committed to Git. All secrets live in .env files (gitignored) or on the platform.

Non-sensitive fields can be hardcoded in config normally:

{
"db": {
"pooler": {
"default_pool_size": 10
}
}
}

For non-sensitive fields, the user has three options:

Hardcode in config — "default_pool_size": 10. Simple, committed to Git, works everywhere.

Implicit binding — omit the value, the platform resolves from SUPABASE_DB_POOLER_DEFAULT_POOL_SIZE if set in the environment.

Explicit env() — "default_pool_size": "env(MY_POOL_SIZE)" for cases where the value should vary per environment.

Resolution precedence for platform variables

For a platform config value like auth.external.google.secret, the resolved value is determined by (first match wins):

Canonical environment variable (SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_SECRET) resolved via the standard resolution chain (OS env → .env.local → .env).

env() override in config — if the user writes "secret": "env(MY_CUSTOM_NAME)", that variable name is used instead of the canonical one (see below).

If none of the above produce a value and the feature is enabled, the CLI warns about the missing variable.

User Variables (env() syntax)

For values the platform doesn't know about — third-party service keys, application-specific config, custom feature flags — the user explicitly references environment variables using the env() syntax in config:

{
"functions": {
"my-function": {
"env": {
"OPENAI_API_KEY": "env(OPENAI_API_KEY)",
"FEATURE_FLAG_V2": "env(FEATURE_FLAG_V2)"
}
}
}
}

The user controls the naming and is responsible for setting these values in the environment.

Overriding canonical names with env()

In rare cases, a user may want a platform config key to read from a non-canonical variable name. The env() syntax serves as an escape hatch:

{
"auth": {
"external": {
"google": {
"enabled": true,
"client_id": "env(MY_GOOGLE_ID)",
"secret": "env(MY_GOOGLE_SECRET)"
}
}
}
}

This overrides the implicit binding — the platform will look for MY_GOOGLE_SECRET instead of SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_SECRET. Most users will never need this.

How platform and user variables appear in .env

When running cli env pull, both types appear in the same file, grouped for clarity:

# Pulled from "development" environment

# auth.external.google

SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=1234567890.apps.googleusercontent.com

# Secrets excluded: SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_SECRET

# User variables

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-abc123
FEATURE_FLAG_V2=true

Summary of variable binding modes

Mode

Config example

When to use

Hardcoded (non-sensitive only)

"default_pool_size": 10

Static config values safe to commit to Git

Implicit (recommended for sensitive)

"enabled": true + values in environment under canonical names

Standard workflow — zero config boilerplate

Explicit env()

"secret": "env(CUSTOM_NAME)" + values in environment under custom names

Edge cases requiring non-canonical names

Variable Types

Every variable is encrypted at rest on the platform. There is no separate "secrets" storage — all variables live in the same system. The distinction is a flag on the variable, not a separate mechanism.

Standard Variables

Can be read, written, listed, and pulled.

Visible in the dashboard and via cli env list.

Included when running cli env pull.

Secret Variables

Write-only after creation. The value cannot be read back from the dashboard, the API, or the CLI.

cli env list displays the key but shows [secret] as the value.

Excluded from cli env pull — they never land in a local .env file automatically.

Useful for production API keys, signing keys, and other high-sensitivity values.

A variable is marked as secret at creation time using the --secret flag and cannot be converted back to standard. To "unsecret" a variable, delete it and recreate it as standard.

How are secrets identified during push?

The .env format has no built-in way to distinguish a secret from a normal variable. Two mechanisms work together to handle this:

Annotation in the .env file. A # @secret comment on the line immediately preceding a variable marks it as secret:

DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/app

# @secret

STRIPE_KEY=sk_live_abc123

# @secret

SIGNING_SECRET=whsec_xyz

The CLI parser looks for this annotation. The file remains a valid .env file for any other tool — the annotation is just a comment. This is the primary mechanism for bulk and scripted workflows.

Interactive prompt for new variables. When pushing variables that don't already exist on the remote and have no # @secret annotation, the CLI prompts:

New variables detected:
STRIPE*KEY = "sk_live*…" Mark as secret? [y/N]
ANALYTICS_ID = "UA-123" Mark as secret? [y/N]

As a convenience, the CLI heuristically suggests [Y/n] (defaulting to yes) if the key matches common sensitive patterns like SECRET, TOKEN, PRIVATE_KEY, PASSWORD, or API_KEY.

For variables that already exist on the platform, their current type (standard or secret) is preserved — the push updates the value but does not change the type. To change a variable from standard to secret or vice versa, the user must delete and recreate it via cli env set.

When --yes is passed (non-interactive mode), variables without a # @secret annotation are pushed as standard. The # @secret annotation is the only way to mark secrets in non-interactive push workflows.

Local File Structure

supabase/
├── config.json # project configuration, uses env() and implicit bindings
├── .env # pulled from "development" environment, gitignored
├── .env.local # personal overrides, gitignored, never synced
└── .gitignore # includes .env\*

All .env\* files are gitignored. There is only ever one .env file — it represents a snapshot of the development environment (or whichever environment was explicitly pulled). There are no .env.production, .env.preview, etc. files sitting on disk.

.env

The working environment file. It is either:

Generated by cli env pull (remote-first) — defaults to pulling from development, or

Created and maintained manually by the user (local-first).

.env.local

Personal overrides that are never pushed to the platform and never shared with teammates. This is where a developer puts truly machine-specific values. With the development environment providing team-agreed local defaults, .env.local should rarely be needed — it's for edge cases like a personal API key or a non-standard local port.

Resolution Order

Resolution differs between local development and deployed environments.

Local development (cli dev)

When the CLI encounters env(DATABASE_URL) in config.json or resolves a platform variable, the value is determined by (first match wins):

OS environment variables — so CI/CD pipelines, Docker, and shell overrides work naturally.

.env.local — personal overrides, never synced.

.env — pulled from the development environment or manually maintained.

Deployed environments (platform)

On the platform, local files are not involved. The resolution is:

Branch-specific override for the variable in the mapped environment (if one exists for the current branch).

Base environment variable in the mapped environment.

CLI Commands

Environment CRUD

# List all environments for the current project

cli env list-environments

# Create a custom environment, optionally seeding it from an existing one

cli env create <n> [--from <source_environment>]

# Seed with interactive review (see below)

cli env create <n> --from <source_environment> --interactive

# Delete a custom environment (production, preview, development cannot be deleted)

cli env delete <n>

# Seed an existing environment from another (e.g., populating production from preview)

cli env seed <target> --from <source> [--interactive]

cli env create --from and cli env seed --from both support seeding, but serve different purposes: create makes a new environment and optionally seeds it, while seed populates an existing environment (such as the default production which already exists but starts empty).

Interactive seeding

When seeding one environment from another, values often need to change — a development database URL is not the same as a production one. The --interactive flag (also available in the dashboard) walks the user through each variable:

Seeding "production" from "preview" (14 variables):

DATABASE_URL = "postgres://preview-db:5432/app"
[K]eep / [E]dit / [S]kip? e
New value: postgres://prod-db:5432/app ✓

API_ENDPOINT = "https://api.preview.example.com"
[K]eep / [E]dit / [S]kip? e
New value: https://api.example.com ✓

LOG_LEVEL = "debug"
[K]eep / [E]dit / [S]kip? e
New value: warn ✓

STRIPE_KEY = [secret]
[E]nter new value / [S]kip? e
New value (hidden): ••••••••••••• ✓
Mark as secret? [Y/n] y ✓

ANALYTICS_ID = "UA-12345"
[K]eep / [E]dit / [S]kip? k ✓

... (9 more)

Created "production" with 13 variables (1 skipped).

For secret variables from the source environment, the value cannot be displayed or copied — the user must enter a new value or skip the variable entirely.

Without --interactive, all variables are copied as-is (secrets included) and the user can edit them afterward with cli env set. This is useful for environments that share most values with the source (e.g., a staging environment seeded from preview).

Variable Management

All variable management commands operate directly on the platform. They require a linked project.

# Set a variable on a specific environment

cli env set <KEY> <value> --env <environment>
cli env set <KEY> <value> --env <environment> --secret

# Set a branch-specific override

cli env set <KEY> <value> --env <environment> --branch <branch>

# Unset (delete) a variable

cli env unset <KEY> --env <environment>
cli env unset <KEY> --env <environment> --branch <branch>

# List all variables for an environment (includes branch overrides)

cli env list --env <environment>

If --env is omitted, the CLI defaults to:

development when running locally (no deployment context).

The active environment based on the current branch mapping when a deployment context is available.

If the project is not linked, the command fails with an error.

Pull (Platform → Local)

# Pull the development environment (default for local work)

cli env pull

# Pull a specific environment

cli env pull --env <environment>

Behavior:

Defaults to development when no --env is specified. This is the expected workflow — developers pull the development environment for local work.

Writes/overwrites supabase/.env with the resolved set of standard variables.

When pulling a deployed environment (preview, production, or custom), branch-specific overrides for the current branch are resolved — the .env file contains final values, not layers.

Secret variables are excluded. A comment is appended listing the excluded secret keys so the developer knows what to add in .env.local:

# Pulled from "development" environment

#

# Secrets excluded (add to .env.local if needed):

# SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_SECRET

# STRIPE_KEY

# auth.external.google

SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=1234567890.apps.googleusercontent.com

# User variables

DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/app
API_URL=http://localhost:3000
FEATURE_FLAG_V2=true

If supabase/.env already exists, it is overwritten without merge. Pull is a full replacement.

Push (Local → Platform)

# Push .env contents to the development environment (default)

cli env push

# Push to a specific environment

cli env push --env <environment>

# Push from a specific file

cli env push --file .env.staging --env staging

# Push without confirmation prompt

cli env push --env development --yes

# Show what would change without applying

cli env push --env development --dry-run

# Remove remote variables not present in the local file

cli env push --env development --prune

Behavior:

Parse the local .env file (or the file specified with --file).

Fetch the current base variables for the target environment from the platform.

Compute a diff and display it:

Pushing to "development" environment:

- NEW_VAR = "hello" (add)
  ~ DATABASE_URL = "postgres://…" (changed)
  = API_ENDPOINT (unchanged, skipped)

* OLD_VAR (remove, only with --prune)

2 additions/changes, 1 removal. Continue? [y/N]

On confirmation, send a single bulk upsert request to the platform API.

Design decisions:

Push defaults to development when no --env is specified, matching pull behavior.

Push always operates on base values. Branch-specific overrides cannot be set via push — they must be set individually with cli env set --branch. This prevents accidentally turning base values into branch-scoped ones.

Without --prune, push only adds and updates — it never deletes remote variables. This is the safe default.

With --prune, variables present on the remote but absent from the local file are deleted. The diff clearly shows removals before confirmation.

Variables marked as secret on the remote cannot have their current value compared (it's unreadable). The diff shows [secret, will be overwritten] for keys that exist both locally and remotely as secrets.

.env.local is never pushed. Only .env (or the file specified with --file) is used as the source.

Branch-Specific Overrides

A variable within a deployed environment (preview, production, or custom) can optionally have overrides scoped to a specific project branch. The base value applies to all project branches mapped to that environment, and a branch override takes precedence for a specific project branch only. This avoids creating a full custom environment when only a few values need to differ.

Each override is scoped to a single project branch. If the same override is needed on multiple branches, it must be set separately for each.

Note: Branch-specific overrides do not apply to the development environment, since it is not mapped to any project branch.

Example

A team has three project branches all mapping to preview. Two of them need a different API endpoint:

# Base value — applies to all project branches mapped to preview

cli env set API_URL "https://preview.example.com" --env preview

# Project branch-specific overrides

cli env set API_URL "https://feature-x.example.com" --env preview --branch feature-x
cli env set API_URL "https://feature-y.example.com" --env preview --branch feature-y

The third project branch (feature-z) gets the base value automatically.

Listing with overrides

preview environment:

API_URL = "https://preview.example.com"
└─ feature-x = "https://feature-x.example.com"
└─ feature-y = "https://feature-y.example.com"
DATABASE_URL = "postgres://preview-db:5432/app"
STRIPE_KEY = [secret]

Pull behavior

cli env pull --env preview resolves the correct value for the current project branch. If the current project branch is feature-x and a branch override exists for API_URL, the pulled .env contains the override value. The user doesn't need to think about layering — the pulled file always contains final resolved values.

Push behavior

cli env push sets base values only. Branch-specific overrides must be set individually with cli env set --branch.

Removing overrides

# Remove a project branch-specific override (the base value remains)

cli env unset API_URL --env preview --branch feature-x

When to use overrides vs custom environments

Scenario

Recommendation

A project branch needs 1–3 different values

Branch-specific override

A long-lived project branch (staging, QA) needs a broadly different config

Custom environment

A developer needs machine-specific overrides

.env.local (no platform involvement)

Workflows

Remote-First (Linked Project)

This is the standard workflow when the user has an existing project on the platform.

│ supabase/.env.local (personal overrides, rarely needed) │
│ │
│ cli dev → reads .env.local → .env → runs local services │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Typical day-to-day:

cli env pull to get the latest development variables.

cli dev — everything works with localhost values. No overrides needed for most developers.

If a variable needs to change for the team, use cli env set to update it in development, or edit .env and cli env push.

Deployed previews and production use their own environments — no interaction with local files.

Local-First (No Linked Project)

The user is working locally without a hosted project. The platform is not involved yet.

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Local only │
│ supabase/.env (manually created) │
│ supabase/.env.local (personal overrides)│
│ supabase/config.json (uses env() syntax) │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Everything works except platform sync:

env() resolves from .env.local → .env → OS environment.

cli dev runs services with the correct variables.

cli env pull / cli env push / cli env set fail with: Error: No linked project. Run "cli link" first.

cli env list-environments, cli env create, cli env delete also fail (environments are a platform concept).

Transitioning from Local-First to Remote-First

When the user links or deploys for the first time:

cli link # or cli deploy

The CLI detects an existing supabase/.env file.

It prompts:

Found local environment variables in supabase/.env.Push them to the "development" environment? [y/N]

On confirmation, the .env contents are pushed to the development environment via the bulk upsert API.

From this point on, pull and push work normally.

When the user is ready to set up deployed environments, they seed preview from development and adjust the values for hosted infrastructure:

cli env seed preview --from development --interactive

Later, when going to production:

cli env seed production --from preview --interactive

This creates a natural progression: development → preview → production, each seeded from the last with values adjusted interactively.

If the remote project already has variables (e.g., set up by a teammate), the CLI detects the conflict:

The "development" environment already has 12 variables on the platform.
Your local .env has 8 variables.

Platform API Requirements

The CLI commands described above require the following platform API endpoints:

Operation

Endpoint

Notes

List environments

GET /projects/{id}/environments

Returns default + custom environments

Create environment

POST /projects/{id}/environments

Accepts optional from for seeding

Delete environment

DELETE /projects/{id}/environments/{name}

Rejects default environments

Seed environment

POST /projects/{id}/environments/{name}/seed

Accepts from, interactive handled client-side

List variables

GET /projects/{id}/environments/{name}/variables

Secret values returned as null

Bulk upsert variables

PUT /projects/{id}/environments/{name}/variables

Accepts full set, computes diff server-side

Set single variable

POST /projects/{id}/environments/{name}/variables

Accepts secret: true and optional branch

Delete single variable

DELETE /projects/{id}/environments/{name}/variables/{key}

Optional branch query param

Pull variables

GET /projects/{id}/environments/{name}/variables?decrypt=true&branch={branch}

Resolves overrides, excludes secrets

The bulk upsert endpoint (PUT) is critical. It should accept an array of {key, value, secret?} objects and an optional prune: boolean flag. The server computes the diff, applies additions/updates, and optionally removes keys not present in the payload. This avoids the one-at-a-time problem that plagues Vercel's CLI.

Dashboard Behavior

The platform dashboard should provide a UI equivalent for all CLI operations:

View and switch between environments. The three defaults (development, preview, production) are always visible.

Add, edit, and delete variables. Secret variables show a masked value that cannot be revealed.

Create and delete custom environments, with the option to seed from an existing one (including interactive review).

Seed an existing environment from another, with an inline UI for reviewing and editing each variable.

Edit the branch-to-environment mapping (equivalent to editing the environments block in config.json).

View and manage branch-specific overrides, clearly distinguished from base values.

The dashboard is an equal citizen to the CLI — not a secondary interface.

Edge Cases and Decisions

What happens if a project branch has no mapping?

It falls back to the wildcard ("\*") mapping. If no wildcard is configured, it defaults to preview. A project branch always resolves to exactly one deployed environment.

Can two project branches map to the same environment?

Yes. For example, all feature branches mapping to preview is the default behavior. Multiple project branches sharing an environment means they share the same base variables (though they can have branch-specific overrides) — this is expected.

Can a variable exist in some environments but not others?

Yes. Environments are independent. ANALYTICS_KEY might exist in production but not in development. If env(ANALYTICS_KEY) is referenced in config.json and the value is missing, the CLI should warn at startup rather than fail silently.

What about multi-line values?

The .env parser must handle multi-line values (using quotes), comments, and empty lines. Use an established parsing library rather than a custom regex.

What about variable expansion in .env files?

Variable expansion (e.g., DATABASE_URL=postgres://${DB_USER}:${DB_PASS}@localhost) is not supported in .env files to keep behavior predictable. Each value is treated as a literal string. Composition should happen in config.json using multiple env() calls if needed.

Summary

Concept

Decision

Environments model

Flat, independent sets — no inheritance

Default environments

development, preview, and production — cannot be deleted

development environment

For local execution only (cli dev). Not mapped to a branch. Team-shared local defaults.

preview / production

For deployed environments. Mapped to branches via config.json.

Sharing between environments

Copy/seed at creation time (with interactive review), no live links. Natural progression: development → preview → production.

Branch-specific overrides

Supported on deployed environments — set per variable per project branch, resolved automatically on pull

Variables

Platform variables (implicit binding) + user variables (env() syntax)

Secrets

A flag on a variable, not a separate system. Identified via # @secret annotation on push

Local files

.env (pulled from development) + .env.local (personal), both gitignored

Source of truth

Platform (remote-first) or .env file (local-first)

Sync model

pull/push default to development. Pull = full replace, push = diff + upsert (base values only) with optional prune

Branch mapping

Configured in config.json, maps project branch names to environments. Wildcard fallback to preview. development is not in the mapping.

Resolution (local)

OS env → .env.local → .env (from development). Planned: cli dev will sync Git branch switches with project branch activation and environment reload.

Resolution (platform)

Branch override → base environment variable

API design

Bulk upsert endpoint to avoid one-at-a-time limitations
